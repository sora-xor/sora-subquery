     *  - Up to one balance-reserve or unreserve operation.
     *  - One passthrough operation, one insert, both `O(S)` where `S` is the number of
     *    signatories. `S` is capped by `MaxSignatories`, with weight being proportional.
     *  - One encode & hash, both of complexity `O(S)`.
     *  - One event.
     *  - I/O: 1 read `O(S)`, one remove.
     *  - Storage: removes one item.
